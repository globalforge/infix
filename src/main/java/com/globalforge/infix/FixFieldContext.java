/**
 * A means to bind a tag number to it's position in the input message. A tag
 * number may appear more than once in a fix message within a repeating group.
 * All tag numbers have a distinct context string that both indicates the tag
 * num and provides information about it's nested position within a message. The
 * infix application maintains the order of tags in the input message. It
 * accomplishes this by mapping a number associated with the tag context in the
 * original message. The FieldContext class is a temporary holder of this
 * information before the member fields are referenced by the mapping event.
 * Examples of tag contexts for tags 35 and 375: &35, &382[0]->&375,
 * &382[1]->&375
